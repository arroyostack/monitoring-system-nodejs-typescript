# NodeJS Monitoring System - Part 1

## Overview

NodeJS Monitoring System project. This section focuses on laying the foundation for the Network Operations Center (NOC). We'll LOOK into key concepts and tools that will set the stage for the development of our monitoring system.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Introduction to Clean Architecture

Get acquainted with Clean Architecture principles, emphasizing the importance of separation of concerns and maintainability in our project.

### 2. Dependency Injection (DI)

Explore Dependency Injection as a crucial design pattern for managing component dependencies and promoting modularity within our application.

### 3. JSON-Server

Learn about JSON-Server, a handy tool for creating a mock REST API, enabling us to simulate interactions with a backend before it's fully developed.

### 4. Use Cases

Understand the various scenarios and interactions our monitoring system will handle, laying the groundwork for feature development.

### 5. CRON Task - Scheduled Tasks

Dive into CRON tasks, exploring how scheduled tasks can enhance the functionality of our monitoring system and automate repetitive processes.

## Section Details

In this section, we provide a comprehensive explanation of our approach to achieving the goal of building a global monitoring system. As we progress through subsequent sections, we'll see these concepts in action, gradually bringing our system to life.

## Project Setup

### Scripts

- **npm install**
- **npm run dev**: Run the development server using `tsnd` with automatic respawn and clearing of the console. Execute the main application file from the `src` directory.
